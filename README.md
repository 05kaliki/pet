# 🐩 Virtual Pet 🐕

A simple app version of the JavaScript virtual pet that was previously created (https://github.com/cocomarine/virtual-pet). Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. 

## Description
The aim of the game is to create pets and keep them alive by feeding and walking. Players can start by adding name of pets and then press 'grow up', 'feed me' or 'walk me' buttons to look after the pet. The pet's name appears as well as whether the pet is hungry, needs walking or is not alive. The pet's status is also as meter bars. When the pet dies, a new name of pet can be entered and the game begins.
